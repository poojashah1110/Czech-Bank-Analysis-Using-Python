# Czech-Bank-Analysis-Using-Python
This project is a detailed analysis of customer data of a real Czech Bank. First, we cleaned the data to make it more accessible for analysis. Then we manipulated the data and created a datamart / a table of all necessary information in a single row per customer. The project was followed by analysis and data visualization for various aspects such as loans, credit cards, transactions, demographics, etc.
The entire coding for the project is done using Python 3 in Jupyter Notebook.
